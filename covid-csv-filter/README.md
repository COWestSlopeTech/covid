## Notes on these data

* Population estimates, used in the calculation of per-capita rates, are based on 2019 estimates from census.gov. They are not annotated for which point in the year the estimate applies to; I don't think seasonal variation is accounted for, nor does it account for potential emi/immigration as a result of COVID.
